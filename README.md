We were given a brief to learn and use Next.js in two days. This provided us the opportunity to work as an Agile team. In order to learn quickly we researched the documentation and watched tutorials before feeding back what we had learned. We used React in Next.js to build, I was excited to see how quickly features were added by using React. It felt natural to write javascript logic nested in our JSX code. When building we used regular commits and opened a new branch for each feature. This felt like operating as a tech team and it excited me and enthused me even more to learn from this task. I plan to return to this project to finish the functionality and styling. I took part in writing the logic to convert an entry in Pounds Sterling to one of the selected currencies. This was a week 11 task and it confirms how much I have learned and grown in confidence on the bootcamp.Â
